# Tricky Algorithm Questions:

  - 1. Longest string in a palindrome 
    - 1. Brute force ( O(n^3) )
    - 2. Dynamic programming ( O(n^2) )
    - 3. Manacher's algorithm ( O(n) )
    
  - 2. Given a lot of numbers (each number inputted one at a time) find and maintain a list of the 100 biggest numbers
    - 1. using min-heap
    
  - 3. You are given 2 integers p and q. Complete the function calculatePower which takes two integers as 
       arguments and returns the p to the power of q, without using the built-in power function. Expectation is to
       do better than O(q).
    - 1. using recursion: lg N
    
  - 4. You are given an integer array n. Complete the function sortIntegers which takes as argument an integer
       array n of upto 1 million integers such that 1<=ni<=10 for every element ni in the array and returns the 
       sorted array. The sort doesn't occure in-place.
    - 1. initialize an array of size maxVal-minVal+1;
         update the array index as arr[minVal+val]++ one value at a time
         print the number/write to a file starting from arr[minVal] to arr[maxVal]
         
  - 5. You are given an alphanumeric string. Complete the function sortSegments that will segment the string into
       substrings of consecutive letters or numbers and then sort the substrings. For example "AZQF013452BAB" will
       result in AFQZ012345ABB".       
    - 1. Split the string into parts and sort each part separately
    
  - 6. Binary representation of a given integer
    - 1. recursively call and check for remainder
    
  - 7.
