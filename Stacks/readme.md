# Stacks and Queues

  - Operations: insert, remove, iterate, test if empty
  - Stack: LIFO = Last in first out
  - Queue: FIFO = first in first out
  
# Client, Implementationm interface:

  - Seperate interface and implementation
  - Benefits:
    - Client doesn't know details of implementation => many implementations to choose from
    - Implementation doesn't details about clients

# Stack methods:

  - push(Object item)
  - pop()
  - isEmpty()
  - size()
