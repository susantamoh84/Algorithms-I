# Iteration

  - Support iteration without knowing internal representation of the stack/queue/..etc
  
  - Java Solution: Iterable interface
    - Only one method: iterator()
    
  - If collection is iterable, then easy to use foreach syntax.
  
  
# Bag API:

  - Adding items to a collection and iterating (when order doesn't matter)
  - Stack without the pop and Queue without the dequeue methods
